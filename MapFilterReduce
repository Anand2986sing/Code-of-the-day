//MAP, FILTER, REDUCE in javaScript

//MAP is same like for each loop but it always create a new array
let arr= [ 1, 3,4,5,9]
let a = arr.map((A) =>{
    console.log(A);
    return A+1;
})
console.log(arr, a)



// Filter is something where we can use conditions
let a1= [4,2,5,9,3];
let newarr1 = a1.filter((A) =>{
    return A>4;
})
console.log(a1, newarr1)


//Reduce in javascript
let a3= [3,4,5,2,41,4,3,3];
let newarr2 = a3.reduce((A, B ) => {
    return A + B;
})
console.log(newarr2);
